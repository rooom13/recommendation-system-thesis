Chilean group formed in 1965 by Julio Carrasco, Eduardo Carrasco, and Julio Numhauser, later joined by Patricio Castillo.
Since its beginning, Quilapayun's lyrics were inspired by social issues related to its country, combining them with autochthonous musical arrangements.
In 1966, the band came in first place at the Festival de Festivales, releasing its first album that same year.
Folk singer and songwriter Víctor Jara helped the band by promoting Quilapayun's music and making the record Canciones Folklóricas de América together.
By the time Julio Numhauser decided to leave, Carlos Quezada and Guillermo Oddo joined in.
As Chilean New Song's ambassador, Quilapayun went on its first European tour in 1968.
When Julio Carrasco left, Hernán Gómez and Rodolfo Parada became part of Quilapayun's new lineup.
Due to Chilean political and social changes in the early '70s, the group settled in foreign countries for more than a decade.
