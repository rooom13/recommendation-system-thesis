Mauri Antero Numminen (Somero, Finland, born March 12, 1940) has been one of the pioneers of Finnish avantgarde/underground &amp; electronic music scene.
In his early days Numminen often consciously tried to provoke people.
Here he succeeded well, for example by his interpretations of Franz Schubert's lieds, sung with his own idiosyncratic singing voice, or managing to create a scandal at the Jyväskylän kesä festival of Jyväskylä in 1966 with his song lyrics taken from a sex guide.
Numminen also did music to the writings of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.M.A.
Numminen became a popular favourite with his children's songs in the 1973 film Herra Huu - Jestapa Jepulis, Penikat Sipuliks, where he also played the main role, and in the 1977 TV series Jänikset maailmankartalle, where he played a hare.
Recently he has been touring with DJ Sane, creating electronic soundscapes and noisish remixes of his own older songs.On tour and records MA is often seen with his long time counterpart Sähkökvartetti.
