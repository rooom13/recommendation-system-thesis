1000 Mexicans were one of the most innovative and creative independent bands of the 1980s, combining quality pop songwriting and rhythmic and harmonic richness with their unique touches of experimentalism and eccentricity.
The band started playing various London, UK clubs in the summer of 1982, and brought their unique instrumentation style with them.Despite success in Europe and consistent critical acclaim, they never found favour with the UK record industry who appeared confused by their singular brand of humour and sometimes anarchic live shows.
The 'hi-flying Burrito Brothers' eventually found themselves in a tangle of bad management and publishing agreements that strangled their creative momentum and finally their will to live.The three band members, Michael Harding, Julian Griffin and Andrew Hobday went their separate ways in 1986.http://www.1000mexicans.co.uk/
