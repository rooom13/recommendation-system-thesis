MASTERMIND was a 70's Funk band from New York City.Comparable to Brass Construction and Mass Production but not nearly as well known, Mastermind was an obscure ten-piece funk-soul band that recorded in New York in the late '70s.
Unlike the Ohio Players, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Tower of Power, the Commodores and other big funk-soul bands of the '70s, Mastermind didn't have a really identifiable lead vocalist.
Several of its members could contribute vocals if called upon to do so, but everyone in the band was a musician first and foremost with the overall sound of the band being more important than the vocals.
Even though funk-soul was Mastermind's foundation, its very danceable and horn-driven music contained jazz overtones.
In fact, jazz musicians David Sanborn, Steve Khan and Jon Faddis were employed on Mastermind's self-titled debut album, which Prelude released in 1977.
Unfortunately, the LP didn't sell, and the band broke up without ever recording a second album.
Mastermind's members included trumpeter/vocalist Anselm Scrubb, baritone and tenor saxophonist Mario Ford, tenor saxophonist/flutist Guy Fuertes, alto saxophonist/flutist Lenny White (not to be confused with the Return to Forever and Twennynine drummer), guitarist/vocalist Joe Frye, keyboardist/vocalist Geoffrey Williams, bassist/vocalist Carl Bain, drummer/vocalist Brian Wilson (not to be confused with the Beach Boys member), percussionist/vocalist Wendell Derrick and percussionist Juan Clouden.
