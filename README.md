# Recommendation system evaluation for collaborative filtering, content-based & hybrid approaches
Bachelor thesis about recommendation system. In this thesis a deep evaluation of a collaborative filtering method, conten-based method and hybrid approach has been carry out.

* For the **Collaborative filtering** method, a _Matrix factorization approach_ was evaluated using [_implicit.py_](implicit.readthedocs.io).
* For the **Content-based** method, a simple class for _tf-idf_ recommendations was built using _sklearn_.
* The **hybrid** approach just combines the results of collaborative filtering and content based methods by mixing them.





## Repository contents
* **get_dataset.py** : Downloads *MSD-A* datased and extracts it.
* **view_data.py** : Generates histogram for observing data distribution.
* **read_data.py** : Saves python objects using pickle for faster execution and testing.
